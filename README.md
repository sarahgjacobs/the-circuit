## Description
Friends and family can now dive deep into the tech world of The Circuit, a sci-fi novel following hacker groups as they compete against each other and the police that chase close at their tails. This website will include an interactive game similar to the training programs in the book, as well as chapter previews, character descriptions, and more!
